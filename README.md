A text is given as an input, the output should be the same as input text using the genetic alogorithm. 

How does it work?
1) Create a population of size n, each element of the population needs to be random.
2) Evaluate each element of the population with a fitness value.
3) Pick elements with highest fitness value (use random Number probabilities to pick an element) n times, where n is the size of the population.
4) Do a cross over or mix two elements n times.
5) Add a mutation to child element. Go back to step 1 until the the output is same as input.
